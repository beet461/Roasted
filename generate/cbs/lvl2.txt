You are like a cloud. When you disappear it’s a beautiful day.
Child, I’ve forgotten more than you ever knew.
I’ve seen people like you before, but I had to pay admission.
I was hoping for a battle of wits but you appear to be unarmed.
I’ve been called worse by better.
Jealousy is a disease. Get well soon.
I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and poop out a smarter statement than whatever you just said.
People like you are the reason I’m on medication.
Earth is full. Go home.
Who ate your bowl of sunshine this morning, thundercloud?
You fear success, but you really have nothing to worry about.
Keep rolling your eyes, you might eventually find a brain.
If your brain was dynamite, there wouldn’t be enough to blow your hat off.
Your only purpose in life is to become an organ donor.
You are proof that evolution can go in reverse.
Grab a straw, because you suck.
Remember when I asked for your opinion? Me neither.
You’re about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.
I believed in evolution until I met you.
That sounds like a you problem.
Unless your name is Google, stop acting like you know everything!
I told my therapist about you.
