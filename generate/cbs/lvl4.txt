You bring everyone so much joy when you leave the room.
I'd give you a nasty look but you've already got one.
Someday you’ll go far. I hope you stay there.
Were you born this stupid or did you take lessons?
Your mouth is bigger than your brain will ever be
You should really come with a warning label.
I don’t know what your problem is, but I’m guessing it’s hard to pronounce.
It’s kind of hilarious watching you try to fit your entire vocabulary into one sentence.
I will ignore you so hard you will start doubting your existence.
Feed your own ego. I’m busy.
I’ll never forget the first time we met. But I’ll keep trying.
You’re a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.
I thought of you today. It reminded me to take out the trash.
Stupidity isn’t a crime, so you’re free to go.
I’ve been called worse by better.
Don’t you get tired of putting makeup on your two faces every morning?
Please just tell me you don’t plan to home-school your kids.
You see that door? I want you on the other side of it.
You’re like the end pieces of a loaf of bread. Everyone touches you, but nobody wants you.
You are more disappointing than an unsalted pretzel.
Your face makes onions cry.
You’re not stupid! You just have bad luck when you’re thinking.
Have a nice day, somewhere else.
If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person on the planet.
If I threw a stick, you’d leave, right?
Somewhere out there, there’s a tree working very hard to produce oxygen so that you can breathe. I think you should go and apologize to it.
